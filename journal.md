In considering whether 100 unarmed people could defeat a silverback gorilla, it is highly unlikely that they would succeed. Silverback gorillas are incredibly strong and possess immense physical power; adult males can weigh between 300 to 485 pounds and have a bite force of over 1,000 pounds per square inch, which is significantly stronger than that of a human. Even if the group of 100 individuals attempted to coordinate their efforts, the sheer strength and agility of the gorilla would likely overwhelm them. Gorillas are also known for their intelligence and social structures, which could allow them to exploit weaknesses in the group's strategy. The risk of injury or fatality among the humans would be substantial, as even one enraged gorilla could incapacitate multiple individuals before they could effectively work together against it. Thus, from a logical standpoint based on biological facts and behavioral studies of both species, it is improbable that 100 unarmed people could successfully defeat a silverback gorilla.

The viral nature of challenges like "100 Men vs 1 Gorilla" raises important ethical questions regarding responsibility in content creation. While such challenges may entertain audiences and spark discussions about human-animal interactions, they can also propagate misunderstandings about wildlife behavior and conservation issues. Viewers might trivialize the serious nature of animal welfare or develop misconceptions about how humans should interact with wild animals. Additionally, this kind of content can encourage reckless behavior among viewers who might attempt similar stunts without understanding the potential dangers involved. The spread of these trends online highlights a complex relationship between entertainment and education; while some may learn about animal strength and behavior through these discussions, many others may simply see it as sensationalism without grasping the underlying realities. This underscores the need for responsible content creation that balances entertainment with factual information to foster informed discussions rather than promoting harmful ideas or actions.
